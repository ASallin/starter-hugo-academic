Welcome. 

I am a PhD candidate in Economics (specialization in Econometrics) at the [Graduate Programme in Economics and Finance (GPEF)](https://www.unisg.ch/en/forschung/doktorat/graduateprogrammeeconomicsandandfinance) of the University of St. Gallen. 

My research lies at the intersection between Economics of Education, applied Causal Machine-Learning, and policy evaluation. In my thesis, I assess policies that foster better educational and economic outcomes for students from minority groups (such as gifted students or students with special needs). I am passionate about developing inclusive, welfare-increasing education policies that guarantee fair initial academic conditions by means of modern machine-learning estimation methods and simulation procedures. 

Beyond my research in Economics, I am a philosopher and trained Logic-based therapist with the [NPCA](https://npcassoc.org/). I am engaged in working on problems of [climate grief and "climate-friendly" virtues](https://www.pdcnet.org/ijpp/content/ijpp_2021_0007_0001_0011_0026). When not coding or writing, you'll find me [running or biking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14815281), cooking, baking sourdough bread, or collaborating on the [Intergifted project](https://www.intergifted.com) with my wife Jennifer.
