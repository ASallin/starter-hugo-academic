# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: While the number of students with identified special needs is increasing in developed countries, there is little evidence on returns to special education in terms of academic outcomes and labor market integration. I investigate short- and long-term returns to special education programs for students with special needs using recent advances in causal machine-learning and computational text analysis. By leveraging detailed student-level written psychological records as well as administrative data, I find that special education programs in inclusive settings have positive returns on academic performance in math and language as well as on employment and wages. Moreover, I uncover an overall positive effect of inclusive special education programs in comparison to segregated programs. However, I find that segregation benefits mostly for nonnative and disruptive students. Finally, using shallow decision trees, I deliver optimal placement rules that increase overall returns for students with special needs and lower educational costs for all.
